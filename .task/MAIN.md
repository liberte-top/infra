- **Last-Sync:** 2026-02-25T10:46:57Z (on ZQXY123deMacBook-Pro.local)
- **Current Context:** WIP checkpoint saved after phase05/06 split and 00->06 validation; next session can continue directly from phase06-centric model.

  - 1.1: Kubectl Unified Script

## Timeline
- [2026-02-25T08:32:08Z] INITIALIZED: Task started on ZQXY123deMacBook-Pro.local.
- [2026-02-25T08:32:08Z] PHASE PUSH: Begin Phase 1.1 (add kubectl unified script + AGENTS command reference).
- [2026-02-25T08:32:51Z] UPDATE: Created .task from ~/.agent-task/templates and initialized Phase 1.1 records.
- [2026-02-25T08:34:38Z] UPDATE: Scope narrowed by user to `scripts/kubectl.sh` only; removed standalone smoke script direction.
- [2026-02-25T08:38:09Z] UPDATE: Added `scripts/kubectl.sh` with kubeconfig defaulting and remote kubectl passthrough via ssh.sh.
- [2026-02-25T08:38:09Z] UPDATE: Updated AGENTS common commands and validated default run (`kubectl get nodes`) successfully.
- [2026-02-25T08:40:54Z] UPDATE: Updated kubectl.sh to enforce tailscale kubeconfig server endpoint before execution.
- [2026-02-25T08:40:54Z] UPDATE: Validation now fails by design: expected `https://43.251.225.184:6443`, actual is `https://127.0.0.1:6443`.
- [2026-02-25T08:45:57Z] UPDATE: Session handoff checkpoint: `scripts/kubectl.sh` implemented and blocking correctly on endpoint mismatch; next step is to confirm remediation strategy with user.
- [2026-02-25T08:48:21Z] UPDATE: User confirmed endpoint policy: strict tailscale internal domain/MagicDNS only; no auto-reconcile fallback.
- [2026-02-25T08:49:55Z] UPDATE: Runtime check shows target tailscale state is `NeedsLogin` with empty `DNSName`/`MagicDNSSuffix`; must establish tailnet/MagicDNS before kubeconfig endpoint can be validated.
- [2026-02-25T09:37:34Z] UPDATE: User changed strategy to remove tailscale logic and return to plain SSH + remote kubectl path.
- [2026-02-25T09:44:56Z] UPDATE: Completed hard-cut cleanup in phase00/03, inventory/status vars, kubectl.sh, and AGENTS docs (`k3s_tailscale_fqdn` -> `k3s_api_endpoint`, `tailscale-kubeconfig` -> `ssh-kubeconfig`).
- [2026-02-25T09:44:56Z] UPDATE: Validated runtime: `./scripts/kubectl.sh` succeeds; `status phase_target=03` succeeds; `rollup 00->03` succeeds and idempotency pass returns `changed=0`.
- [2026-02-25T09:50:18Z] UPDATE: Full regression passed: `status phase_target=05` all `cur-success`; `rollup 00->05` succeeded; second `rollup 00->05` idempotency pass returned `changed=0`.
- [2026-02-25T09:51:50Z] UPDATE: Created WIP commit `9297f34` (`WIP: hard-cut tailscale path and validate phase 00-05`) for next-session continuation.
- [2026-02-25T09:55:27Z] UPDATE: Simplified `scripts/kubectl.sh`: removed duplicated `require_env` checks and `--kubeconfig` arg scanning; now passes `KUBECONFIG` env to remote kubectl by default.
- [2026-02-25T09:55:27Z] UPDATE: Validation passed after simplification (`bash -n scripts/kubectl.sh` and `./scripts/kubectl.sh`).
- [2026-02-25T09:56:54Z] UPDATE: Removed `scripts/ci.sh` per user request and updated AGENTS repository map; grep check confirms no residual `ci.sh` references.
- [2026-02-25T09:58:56Z] UPDATE: Updated `scripts/kubectl.sh` to require `INFRA_KUBECTL_BIN` and `INFRA_KUBECONFIG_PATH` as mandatory env vars.
- [2026-02-25T09:58:56Z] UPDATE: Added kubectl defaults to `.env.example` and documented both vars in AGENTS runtime parameters.
- [2026-02-25T09:58:56Z] UPDATE: Validation: syntax passed; runtime intentionally fails on current local `.env` because required kubectl vars are not yet configured.
- [2026-02-25T09:59:42Z] UPDATE: Re-validation after user `.env` update passed; both kubectl env vars are present and `./scripts/kubectl.sh` returns healthy node list.
- [2026-02-25T10:10:01Z] UPDATE: Refactored phase model: extracted cert-manager lifecycle from phase05 into new phase06; phase05 now owns helm binary lifecycle only.
- [2026-02-25T10:10:01Z] UPDATE: Validation passed: `status phase_target=06` all `cur-success`; first `rollup 00->06` converged; second `rollup 00->06` idempotency pass returned `changed=0`.
- [2026-02-25T10:46:57Z] UPDATE: Created WIP commit `a3d4339` (`WIP: split phase05 helm-only and add phase06 cert-manager`) for session handoff.
